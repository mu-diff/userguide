   exhibits a fixed computational cost for arbitrarily high frequencies.
   At the core of the method is an extension of the method of stationary

Abstract = {{The scattering of longitudinal and shear waves from spherical,
   nucleated cells and three-dimensional tissues with simple and
   hierarchical microstructures was numerically modeled at the microscopic
   level using an iterative multipole approach. The cells were modeled
   with a concentric core-shell (nucleus-cytoplasm) structure embedded in
   an extracellular matrix. Using vector multipole expansions and boundary
   conditions, scattering solutions were derived for single cells with
   either solid or fluid properties for each of the cell components.
   Tissues were modeled as structured packings of cells. Multiple
   scattering between cells was simulated using addition theorems to
   translate the multipole fields from cell to cell in an iterative
   process. Backscattering simulations of single cells indicated that
   changes in the shear properties and nuclear diameter had the greatest
   effect on the frequency spectra. Simulated wave field images and
   high-frequency spectra (15-75 MHz) from tissues containing 1211-2137
   cells exhibited up to 20\% enhancement of the field amplitudes at the
   plasma membrane, significant changes in spectral features due to
   neoplastic and other microstructural alterations, and a detection
   threshold of similar to 8.5\% infiltration of tumor cells into normal
   tissue. These findings suggest that histology-based simulations may
   provide insight into fundamental ultrasound-tissue interactions and
   help in the development of new medical technologies.}},

   of exact theory and an improved Gersten and Nitzan model}},
Journal = {{Physical Review B}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{11}},
Abstract = {{We present a theoretical study of the modifications of the radiative
   and nonradiative decay rates of an optical emitter in close proximity
   to a noble-metal nanosphere, based on exact electrodynamical theory. We
   show that the optimal nanosphere diameter for luminescence quantum
   efficiency enhancement associated with resonant coupling to plasmon
   modes is in the range of 30-110 nm, depending on the material
   properties. The optimal diameter is found to be a trade-off between (1)
   emitter-plasmon coupling, which is most effective for small spheres,
   and (2) the outcoupling of plasmons into radiation, which is most
   efficient for large spheres. In addition, we show that the well-known
   Gersten and Nitzan model does not describe the existence of a finite
   optimal diameter unless the model is extended with the correction
   factor for radiation damping. With this correction and a correction for
   dynamic depolarization, the mathematically simpler Gersten and Nitzan
   model provides a reasonably accurate approximation of the decay rate
   modifications associated with coupling to the dipole plasmon mode. We
   anticipate that the Gersten and Nitzan model in the form that we
   validate in this paper for spheres will allow the analytical
   investigation of the influence of shape anisotropy on plasmon-enhanced
   luminescence.}},

   spheres: Effects of microstructure and multiple scattering}},
Journal = {{Physical Review B}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{5}},
Abstract = {{A numerical modeling approach was developed to predict the dielectric
   properties of heterogeneous particulate materials with arbitrary
   microstructures. To test the method, simulation and experimental data
   were acquired for the effective permittivities of various glass sphere
   suspensions. Both ordered lattices and random microstructures of up to
   3600 spheres were modeled for volume fractions of 0.025-0.60. The
   electric fields in the suspensions were computed using an iterative
   multipole method that included multiple-scattering effects. The
   effective permittivities were obtained by averaging the electric field
   and electric displacement over a representative volume. Frequency
   spectra, electric field images, and single-scattering results (i.e., no
   particle-particle interactions) were additionally generated. The
   results were compared to experimental data for random close-packed
   microstructures, to effective-medium approximations, to exact lattice
   models, and to a perturbation expansion model. The comparisons showed
   that the iterative models agreed with the exact lattice models to
   within 3.31\% for crystalline suspensions. Results for random
   suspensions agreed with the perturbation expansion model to within
   1.76\% for volume fractions up to 0.50. Single-scattering models
   additionally predicted permittivities for the microstructures as well
   as or better than the Maxwell Garnett approximation {[}Philos. Trans.
   R. Soc. London, Ser. A 203, 385 (1904)], suggesting that
   microstructural effects and multipole moments higher than the dipole
   are required for more accurate statistical prediction of effective
   permittivities. The effective permittivities, convergence behavior, and
   dispersion behavior of the simulations were sensitive to both
   microstructure and the extent of multiple scattering included in the
   models, illustrating how the macroscopic properties depend
   significantly on the microscopic details of the interactions. In
   contrast to other approaches, the iterative multipole method can model
   both the frequency and spatial dependencies of the electromagnetic
   properties of particulate materials, as well as a wide variety of
   microstructures, including polydisperse and hierarchical systems.}},

abstract = "In this paper, the radiation and scattering problems with circular boundaries are studied by using the null-field integral equations in conjunction with degenerate kernels and Fourier series to avoid calculating the Cauchy and Hadamard principal values. In implementation, the null-field point can be located on the real boundary owing to the introduction of degenerate kernels for fundamental solution. An adaptive observer system of polar coordinate is considered to fully employ the property of degenerate kernels. For the hypersingular equation, vector decomposition for the radial and tangential gradient is carefully considered. This method can be seen as a semi-analytical approach since errors attribute from the truncation of Fourier series. Neither hypersingularity in Burton and Miller approach nor the \{CHIEF\} concepts were required to deal with the problem of irregular frequencies. Four gains, well-posed model, singularity free, boundary-layer effect free and exponential convergence are achieved by using the present approach. A fast convergence rate in exponential order than algebraic one in \{BEM\} stems from the series expansions. Three examples were demonstrated to see the validity of the present formulation and show the better accuracy than BEM. "

abstract = "In this paper, 2D eigenproblems with the multiply connected domain are studied by using the multipole Trefftz method. We extend the conventional Trefftz method to the multipole Trefftz method by introducing the multipole expansion. The addition theorem is employed to expand the Trefftz bases to the same polar coordinates centered at one circle, where boundary conditions are specified. Owing to the introduction of the addition theorem, collocation techniques are not required to construct the linear algebraic system. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be found at the same time by employing the singular value decomposition (SVD). To deal with the eigenproblems, the present method is free of pollution of spurious eigenvalues. Both the eigenvalues and eigenmodes compare well with those obtained by analytical methods and the \{BEM\} as shown in illustrative examples. "

abstract = "A Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) condition is derived for the numerical solution of time-harmonic multiple scattering problems, where the scatterer consists of several disjoint components. It is obtained by combining contributions from multiple purely outgoing wave fields. The DtN condition yields an exact non-reflecting boundary condition for the situation, where the computational domain and its exterior artificial boundary consist of several disjoint components. Because each sub-scatterer can be enclosed by a separate artificial boundary, the computational effort is greatly reduced and becomes independent of the relative distances between the different sub-domains. The DtN condition naturally fits into a variational formulation of the boundary-value problem for use with the finite element method. Moreover, it immediately yields as a by-product an exact formula for the far-field pattern of the scattered field. Numerical examples show that the DtN condition for multiple scattering is as accurate as the well-known DtN condition for single scattering problems [J. Comput. Phys. 82 (1989) 172; Numerical Methods for Problems in Infinite Domains, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1992], while being more efficient due to the reduced size of the computational domain. "
