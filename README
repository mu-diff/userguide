How to compile the userguide
============================

The file to compile using pdflatex is:
  mu-diff-user-guide.tex


How to contibute to this userguide, written in LaTeX.
======================================================

1- Commands

Except for the classical LaTeX command, here are set :

Writting inline MATLAB code :
- \code{My Matlab Code}
- \tabcode{My Matlab Code} if in a tabular environement (weird behavior, also try to mixte with \code...)

Writting the name of a folder:
- \folder{MyFolder}

Writting a listing of code (will get a solid box surrounding the code)
- \lstlisting{
a =2;
b = a;
}

2- List of functions

This is done thanks to :
- An XML file containing every functions, their folder and a summary
- A small code that translate this XML file to 2 LaTeX files, where the functions are ordered by name or folder

FOR NAMEL ORDERING:
    \funByName{Name}{Folder}{Summary}
There is also
\funByNameEven{Name}{Folder}{Summary}
\funByNameUneven{Name}{Folder}{Summary}
they are exactly as \funByName but one is grayed and the other one is whited

FOR FOLDER ORDERING
Highlighting a new folder (ordering by folder)
	     \NewFolder{MyFolder}
Displaying a function (ordering by
	       \funByFolder{Name}{Summary}
There is also
\funByFolderEven{Name}{Summary}
\funByFolderUneven{Name}{Summary}
they are exactly as \funByFolder but one is grayed and the other one is whited
