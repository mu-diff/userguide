The \mudiff toolbox is based on integral equation and, in fact, provides the the four classical boundary integral operators. The derivation and the choice of the integral formulation is let to the user, even if some of them are given in this chapter, which contains all the necessary mathematical background to solve  time-harmonic wave scattering problems by disks, by penetrable or impenetrable obstacles. The only limitation is the integral formulation: if the integral formulation is written, then it can be solved using \mudiff.

This chapter begins by presenting the potential theory and the four classical boundary integral operators with their main properties. The case of the scattering by disks is then studied and the boundary integral operators are projected in the Fourier bases, leading to infinite matrices but with analytic expression of the coefficients. The case of the truncation is then discussed, and the chapter concludes with the expression of both the near- and far-field, and the projections of the right-hand side on the Fourier bases (incident wave).
