\section*{Requierement}

\mudiff needs Matlab software, version 2011 or higher. The previous version should work fine, however without guarantee. Matlab can be bough and downloaded at \url{http://www.mathworks.com/}.

\section*{Install}

The install process is done as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download the \mudiff toolbox, either using \texttt{git} with
\begin{verbatim}
git clone http://mu-diff.math.cnrs.fr/git mu-diff
\end{verbatim} 
or by downloading the zip file and unzipping it here:
\begin{center}
\url{http://mu-diff.math.cnrs.fr/mu-diff/Download_files/mudiff.zip}
\end{center}
\item Add the \mudiff toolbox to Matlab's path (including subfolders !), using either the graphical interface of Matlab or the \code{addpath} and \code{save path} functions.
\item Test the \mudiff function by typing in the Matlab command window:
\begin{lstlisting}
BenchmarkDirichlet;
\end{lstlisting}
This should solve the multiple scattering problem using classical boundary integral equation, described in chapter \ref{chap:math}, with in addition, the radar cross section and the history of GMRES of the boundary integral equations.
\item Other test can be launched to be sure every integral operators are working fine:
\begin{lstlisting}
BenchmarkNeumann;
BenchmarkPenetrable;
BenchmarkCalderon;
\end{lstlisting}
\item If everything goes right: congratulation! you install of \mudiff is working!
\end{enumerate}

If you want to see some other use of \mudiff, you can try and launch the following time reversal experiment:
\begin{lstlisting}
DORT_NotPenetrable;
DORT_dielectric;
\end{lstlisting}
